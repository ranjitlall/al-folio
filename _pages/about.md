I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of International Relations](https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Relations) at the London School of Economics. Since 2018, I have also been affiliated with [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford, as an Associate Member.

My research lies at the intersection of international political economy and international organization, with a particular focus on the performance and asssessment of international institutions and the politics of global financial regulation. I have also conducted research on techniques for analyzing missing data in political science and other disciplines.

I received my PhD in Government from Harvard University and my BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford. I spent a year as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance](https://niehaus.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University prior to joining the London School of Economics.

I have received the [Merze Tate Award](https://politicalsciencenow.com/ranjit-lall-2019-merze-tate-award-recipient/) for best dissertation in the field of international relations, law, and politics from the American Political Science Association and the [Leamer-Rosenthal Prize for Open Social Science](https://www.bitss.org/people/ranjit-lall/) from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences. Before beginning my graduate studies, I worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as an editorial writer at the Financial Times.
