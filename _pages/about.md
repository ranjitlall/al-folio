I am an Associate Professor of International Political Economy at the University of Oxford (St. John's College).

My research focuses on the political economy of international cooperation, technological change, and development. I also have methodological interests in machine learning and the analysis of missing data. My forthcoming book _Making International Institutions Work_ seeks to explain differences in the performance of international institutions.

I received my PhD in Government from Harvard University and my BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford. I have received the [Merze Tate Award](https://politicalsciencenow.com/ranjit-lall-2019-merze-tate-award-recipient/) for best dissertation in the field of international relations, law, and politics from the American Political Science Association and the [Leamer-Rosenthal Prize for Open Social Science](https://www.bitss.org/people/ranjit-lall/) from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences. Before beginning my graduate studies, I worked as an economist at the Bank of England and an editorial writer at the Financial Times.
