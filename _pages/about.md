I am an Assistant Professor of International Political Economy at the London School of Economics.

My research interests span a variety of topics in the field of international political economy, including the performance of international institutions, the global regulation, the political impact of COVID-19, and the analysis of missing data. I received my PhD in Government from Harvard University and my BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford. I have received the [Merze Tate Award](https://politicalsciencenow.com/ranjit-lall-2019-merze-tate-award-recipient/) for best dissertation in the field of international relations, law, and politics from the American Political Science Association and the [Leamer-Rosenthal Prize for Open Social Science](https://www.bitss.org/people/ranjit-lall/) from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences. Before beginning my graduate studies, I worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as an editorial writer at the Financial Times.
