I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of International Relations](https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Relations) at the London School of Economics.

My research lies at the intersection of international political economy and international organization. My main interests are the performance and asssessment of international institutions, the politics of global financial regulation, and the analysis of missing data.

I received my PhD in Government from Harvard University and my BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford. I have received the [Merze Tate Award](https://politicalsciencenow.com/ranjit-lall-2019-merze-tate-award-recipient/) for best dissertation in the field of international relations, law, and politics from the American Political Science Association and the [Leamer-Rosenthal Prize for Open Social Science](https://www.bitss.org/people/ranjit-lall/) from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences. Before beginning my graduate studies, I worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as an editorial writer at the Financial Times.
