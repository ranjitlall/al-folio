**Performance of International Institutions Project (PIIP) 1.0**, [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ranjitlall/piip)

The PIIP is the most comprehensive dataset on the performance of international institutions. It includes performance ratings of 54 major institutions between 2008 and 2018 by the governments of Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK and the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN). A wealth of additional information on these institutions, including on their policy autonomy, governance tasks, and operational partnerships, is also provided. The dataset, which is provided in CSV format and accompanied by a detailed codebook, was introduced in my book _Making International Institutions Work_.

**Project Performance Database (PPD) 2.1**, [hosted by AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/data/project-performance-database-ppd-version-2-0)

The PPD is the world's largest database of international development projects that includes quantitative ratings of holistic project performance. Version 2.0, developed jointly with Dan Honig and Bradley Parks, undergirds our 2022 _American Journal of Political Science_ article "[When Does Transparency Improve Institutional Performance?](https://ranjitlall.github.io/assets/pdf/Honig,%20Lall,%20and%20Parks%202022%20AJPS%20online.pdf)" The PPD 2.0 contains evaluations of more than 20,000 unique foreign aid projects in 183 countries between 1956 and 2016 by 12 bilateral and multilateral aid agencies. The dataset is available in CSV and DTA format; a codebook details its contents.

Most of the datasets used in my other research can be accessed from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/harvard/?q=ranjit+lall).
